# ELEVATOR PLANNING

The current project is an assignement from the course "intelligent planning" done at the Universitat Politècnica de València.

It's aim is to create a planner for a predefined problem (in this case the problem of a set of elevators with different boundaries and limitations that have to transport passengers from a starting floor to their finishing floor in the fastest way possible).

The implementation takes into consideration three main topics with three different problem instances:
* normal planning
* temporal domain 
* numerical resources

The implementation is done throught the usage of the PDDL language and ran multiple times for the performance evaluation through three different planners: FF, LPG and OPTIC.

Project executed by Tommaso Sacchetti and Fabian Sparbrodt.
